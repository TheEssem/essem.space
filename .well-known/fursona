It has blue eyes that look like electronic displays, a blue/cyan nose and tongue, two red and green LEDs at the edge of the right ear, a gold collar with a red and white checkered ball, an access panel on the back, visible seams on the elbows/ears/hands, and a transparent cap at the end of the tail that appears to blend in with the rest of the tail. There are multiple shots of it; one shows it standing and looking straight towards the viewer smiling, one shows its back facing towards the viewer, one shows a close-up of its face with it sticking out its tongue, and another shows it being pat on the head with a relaxed expression.",
