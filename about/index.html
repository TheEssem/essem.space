  About me
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>I am a 21-year-old software developer and system administrator from the <span class="cap">US</span>.</strong> Although I had tinkered with it slightly for years beforehand, I started to take programming more seriously around 2017-2018 and have been developing multiple projects since.</p>
<p><strong>I also typically work with multimedia-adjacent things;</strong> this includes audio, video, and images, as well as the internals of those things. Once upon a time I made videos online, but I don't really do much of that anymore (though I still want to get back into it!). I do, however, dabble with music production from time to time, though I still haven't actually released anything.</p>
<p><strong>I am neurodivergent,</strong> having autism, ADHD, and OCD. I feel that support, acceptance, and advocacy for neurodivergent people is very important, as we are typically underrepresented and unaccounted for in society, and what awareness we have typically comes in forms that harm us - oftentimes unbeknownst to those trying to help.</p>
<p>I am asexual and non-binary, <strong>and typically use he/him or they/them pronouns</strong> (it/its also works, especially if we're somewhat close).</p>
<p>As probably expected at this point on the page, <strong>I have a fursona.</strong> You can see more about it <a href="https://fursona.gmem.ca/essem.space">here</a>.</p>
